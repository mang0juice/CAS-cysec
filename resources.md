- Bitdefender (I use this one, since it comes with our NETGEAR router, and it's pretty feature-packed)
    - https://www.bitdefender.com
    - I'm not really sure how the free version looks, but it's pretty good!
- Microsoft Defender; f.k.a. Windows Defender (People may not know how to use it well, so here's a HowToGeek article on it)

## HTML Templates

- Colorlib (A LOT of templates, and they have both HTML and Bootstrap templates)
    - https://colorlib.com/wp/templates/
    - The website has previews for the templates too, which is handy

- Personal Category on Colorlib
    - https://colorlib.com/wp/cat/personal/
    - Templates for making personal or resume websites, but the page setup for a lot of these are pretty good, so less tweaking required

    - Portfolio 2 Template on Colorlib
        - https://colorlib.com/wp/template/portfolio-2/
        - It's got a page setup like we want, and it looks pretty clean
        - I added a branch with this template, so you could see how it looks.
        - https://github.com/mang0juice/CAS-cysec/tree/Portfolio-Template

- W3Schools - W3.CSS Templates (It's W3Schools)
    - https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_templates.asp
    - They say "You are free to modify, save, share, and use them in all your projects"
- Bootstrap (It's a toolkit for building websites, but it's probably another learning curve)
    - https://getbootstrap.com
